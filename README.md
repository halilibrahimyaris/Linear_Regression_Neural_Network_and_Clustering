# Linear_Regression_Neural_Network_and_Clustering


# Use python to cluster the points that given in the file points.txt. Use K-means algorithm. You should use different number of clusters 2,3,4, and 5. Draw the results of each case and show the points of each cluster with different color. Explain which one is the best and discuss the results.
1.	2 Clusters

	I think we can represent our data more efficient and clearer with increasing our clusters counts. By this way we can understand more easily what our data tell us or how many type data do we have. But after a point our data can become unreadable, and we can’t make any suggestion about our data. At that point we keep balance between our cluster count and our data size. At this example we have 100 data (point), and each data has two dimensions. And we can examine some clustering examples with my programs outputs.

	I think 5 cluster is the best one for the other clusters do we have. As seen in the picture above we have more clear difference between our clusters and, they are clustered more successful. In 4 cluster we have some nested points between our clusters and it making some suggestions become more difficult at that point.
